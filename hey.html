            <h1>HEY Email â€“ My Thoughts</h1>
            <p>
                I desperately wanted to love this product. The idea is spot on, and Jason Fried has become one of my favorite product people in the world. Did you watch this <a href="https://youtu.be/UCeYTysLyGI">demonstration</a> he gave? I mean, shit! However, after using Hey for about 12 hours, there were just too many problems to commit to a switch from Apple Mail. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The onboarding experience was incredible. I enjoyed the flow and it made me feel great about getting set up (really important). Everything seemed easy, considered, and well-executed. 
            </p>
            <p>
                But once it was game time, I started to like it less and less:
                <ol>
                    <li>I flat out hated the button floating in the bottom center of the display. It doesn't do it for me. In an iPhone app, the main navigator button should not be here.. it feels unnatural and draws my eye to it (away from the content - where my focus should be). Other apps like Twitter have done it right, with the 'New Tweet' button floating in the bottom right (easy access for my thumb while holding my phone). 
                    </li>
                    <li>More on this main Hey button: Switching to different views (Imbox, The Feed, Paper Trail, etc.) requires me to tap the Hey button and then select which view I want. Maybe I'm being too picky, but it's just an unnecessary tap to navigate around. I'm not a fan of tabs either, but they do reduce the amount of interaction required to move through an app.</li>
                    <li>
                        Composing an email from within an email application should be a main function. In Hey, the '+ Write' button is only available at the top of the Imbox view. If I want to start writing an email while I'm in The Feed, why do I have to navigate back to the Imbox first (which, as mentioned, is too hard for me - I guess)? But then we have a good solution in the Drafts view, with the beautiful button in the bottom right.. WTF? 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Now I know I'm being really picky here, but there is no ':' after Subject while writing an email. It looks like the word Subject is part of my subject.. it upsets me. In the To field it's not a big deal because the email addresses are changed to tokens.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Too many features. One example: I cringed when I saw there were Sticky Notes. It puts into my mind images of a cluttered desk with physical sticky notes hanging all over the monitor and drawers. Yuck..
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Not specific to Hey, but switching to a new email is actually really fucking difficult. So many aspects of my life are tied to my gmail address, I don't even know how to get out. Auto-forwarding, sure, but even that is messy and makes my head spin. And for $$, I can't justify it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The text editing options while writing an email are worse than Apple Mail. We need at least as good here. 
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, now that I write some of this down, maybe it's just the UI that needs some love. Well, and we should simplify a bit. This product needs to focus more on hitting these novel ideas out of the park, and less on power user, super-productivity nerd features. But don't get me wrong, I love Hey.. I just can't use it for now. That doesn't mean it's not for you. So, try it out: <a href= https://hey.com > Hey.com</a>
